### BankingCorp

BankingCorp is not breaking any GDPR laws as long as they make sure the customers are informed promptly and the changes are explained clearly. Since customers are also able to opt-out of receiving these offers, legally its permissible. On the other hand, it is a cause for concern ethically speaking. According to [NACA](https://www.consumeradvocates.org/for-consumers/predatory-lending/), payday loans are predatory and bring with them a lot of negatives. Allowing direct marketing to already vulnerable customers means that the users best interest are not being considered within this partnership. BankingCorp could add restrictions within the agreement between the loan company so that financially vulnerable customers are protected. The algorithm should take the restrictions into account too. They should also ensure that the marketing is as transparent as possible so that the customers know fully what they are opting in to.
