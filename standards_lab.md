<ul> Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal? </ul>
<ul> What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal? </ul>
<ul> What could the company do to address these issues?</ul>

### BankingCorp

BankingCorp is not breaking any GDPR laws as long as they make sure the customers are informed promptly and the changes are explained clearly. Since customers are also able to opt-out of receiving these offers, legally its permissible. On the other hand, it is a cause for concern ethically speaking. According to [NACA](https://www.consumeradvocates.org/for-consumers/predatory-lending/), payday loans are predatory and bring with them a lot of negatives. Allowing direct marketing to already vulnerable customers means that the users best interest are not being considered within this partnership. BankingCorp could add restrictions within the agreement between the loan company so that financially vulnerable customers are protected. The algorithm should take the restrictions into account too. Also adding features that warn and reiterate to customers exactly what they are signing up to, will act as a buffer so they have time to reconsider before making hasty finicial decisions.



### Treasure Hunters

This company is also not breaking any laws in its proposal as long as the data being processed is only information relevent to the game and purchasing of the maps & hints. However, reliability of the algorithms in place for data security are a cause for concern. Now that popularity has rapidly increased, can the code written to keep the data secure be scalable? Treasure Hunters should update their programs so that the database is still maintainable even with more traffic.

Another ethical concern is with the rise of popularity, the mobile game could be using unethical designs to create addictions. With monetization in mind, this can become exacerbated. To deal with this, Treasure Hunters could limit the amount of maps one can play daily. Allowing maybe a few more attempts for those paying so there is still an incentive for spending money.
